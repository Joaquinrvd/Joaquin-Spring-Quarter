Use the MDA framework to analyze your modified game. Write down your game then fill out these sections:
we changed some rules and fellings that come from the game. this is tower of luck, you have to roll a 
dice and what number the dice lands you have to remove that amount. this game is now luck and skill.


Mechanics - What rule/mechanic did your modify in your game? 
Dynamics - How does the gameplay of your modded game differ from that original version?
How much does your modification change how the game feels to plays? What emotions change in players between both versions?

Mechanics -  you have to roll a dice and what number the dice lands you have to remove that amount 
Dynamics - the game is all up to luck now 
Aesthetics - this game keeps you on teh edge of your seat at all times and is a bit rage inducing at times
